Implementation of some data mining algorithms
 
Mainly includesï¼š

### I. Basic data analysis

1. Calculation of data metrics such as mean value

2. visualization methods such as box plots, histograms and scatter plots of data

### II. Clustering

1.Based on hierarchy: Agenes

2. based on density: K-mean, K-mediods, DB

3. advanced clustering: Gaussian mixture model clustering

### III. Classification

1. SVM

2. Decision Tree

### IV. the algorithm based on the KDD-CUP99 dataset in practice

Comprehensive use of decision tree, bagging, random forest, cnn and the corresponding advanced improvement algorithm to classify network attacks
